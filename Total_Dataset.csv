"The increasing complexity of software and communication interfaces in Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) has made them more susceptible to various attacks, leading to significant privacy and security concerns. Effective cybersecurity measures are essential to mitigate these threats, as breaches can result in severe consequences. Common security risks associated with IoT and CPS include inadequate vulnerability testing, unpatched vulnerabilities, reliance on default passwords, and outdated firmware, which collectively create an expanded attack surface for malicious actors. Moreover, the interconnected nature of these systems complicates traditional security approaches, necessitating robust cybersecurity solutions that address both the digital and physical aspects of these environments. Organizations must prioritize the implementation of comprehensive security strategies to safeguard their IoT and CPS infrastructures against evolving threats.

"The study highlights key differences in vendor characteristics across sourcing strategies, noting that single-sourcing providers are typically larger, more established firms with greater cybersecurity resources and capabilities, enabling stronger system protection and vulnerability management [17]. In contrast, best-of-breed (BoB) vendors often consist of smaller niche players with limited resources, increasing their susceptibility to business instability and weaker cybersecurity practices due to constrained threat detection and mitigation efforts [4]. Furthermore, larger vendors exhibit heightened cybersecurity awareness and more consistent secure behaviors compared to smaller firms, reinforcing the link between vendor size, stability, and cybersecurity performance. These findings underscore the trade-offs between sourcing strategies, where vendor reliability and security posture vary significantly based on organizational scale and market positioning.

"In the next section, we show that our closed loop load following controller actually acts as a local supplementary control to bring back to zero the deviation in frequency due to the variation in load when there is no centralized AGC. This is true only if all the load variations in the system are supplied through bilateral contracts. Of course, it is unlikely that the power system can perform adequately without classical supplementary control. Still, even considering a scenario in which all the load variations are supplied through contracts, the system will require centralized control to address such concerns as losses, that cannot be completely included in a bilateral contract.",2001.0,Feasibility of a Bilateral Market for Load Following,04-Nov-01,1

"Cybersecurity concerns, including malware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, phishing, unauthorized data access, and SQL injections, pose significant threats. These issues can compromise the performance of medical care applications within the Industrial Internet of Healthcare Things (IIoHT) architecture and system, potentially leading to severe consequences for consumers and patients. These cybersecurity challenges are particularly critical and distinct from conventional issues. For example, software must be protected from malware, wireless networks from viruses, and servers from anomalous activities. While known cyberattacks on data are readily detectable within a network, undetected attacks residing at various layers of the IIoHT mechanism for medical applications can cause substantial problems [8], [9], [10], [11]. Cyber-physical system (CPS)-based computational methodologies offer automated detection of cybersecurity issues within IIoHT-based applications.

"In an asymmetric system, for the embedded watermark to be detected using the standard correlation test, there must be some correlation between the detector's reference watermark and the embedding watermarks. There are various methods to generate signals that differ from but maintain a fixed correlation with a given reference watermark. One straightforward approach is to create a weighted sum of the watermark and random noise. Hartung and Girod [2] suggested substituting part of the watermark with random noise.

"In a chaotic communication system using lasers with delayed optical feedback, data protection traditionally relies on the need for nearly identical transmitter and receiver devices. In this study, we assume this requirement is no longer met (i.e., the eavesdropper has an identical receiver). The proposed security scheme is based on a predefined variation of the feedback phase, leveraging the inherent limitations of synchronization temporal response. The feedback phase acts as a shared key between the transmitter and receiver for synchronization. While one might compare this to algorithmic encryption before encoding data onto the chaotic carrier, the two approaches differ significantly. Algorithmic encryption increases processing power requirements and is vulnerable to decryption attacks. In contrast, the proposed method requires no additional processing power and relies on fundamental physical limitations for security.",,Feedback Phase in Optically Generated Chaos: A Secret Key for Cryptographic Applications,,0
"The CAS typically operates in a three-level hierarchy for key distribution. The server selects a random variable, known as the Control Word (CW), as the seed for a pseudo-random generator (PRG). The pseudo-random sequence generated by the PRG is used to scramble the transported stream (TS). Simultaneously, the CW is encrypted with an authorization key (AK) to create an Entitlement Control Message (ECM). The AK and other entitlement information are encrypted together using the Master Private Key (MPK) to form an Entitlement Management Message (EMM). The ECM, EMM, and scrambled TS stream are then multiplexed into a new TS stream and transmitted to subscribers via the broadcasting channel. To prevent malicious modifications, the ECM and EMM must be transferred with their respective digital signatures.
The Subscribers Management System (SMS) manages customers' access rights to protected services, such as adding or removing access rights by generating or updating the MPK stored in the smartcard. To enhance system security, the CAS can frequently change the CWs or use more complex symmetric encryption algorithms to scramble the program. In a typical CAS, CWs are changed every 5 to 20 seconds, significantly reducing the risk of known-plaintext attacks.",2004.0,A Scalable Key Distribution Scheme for Conditional Access System in Digital Pay-TV System,02-May-04,0

"To handle unpredictable real-world scenarios, electric vehicles (EVs) have become integral to a vast network of interconnected entities, known as Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). These intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) facilitate communication with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians through various modes, including V2X (which encompasses V2N, V2V, V2I, and V2P) and Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC). However, ICVs face significant security and complexity challenges. Research has explored different communication technologies, such as DSRC and C-V2X, highlighting their architectures and vulnerabilities. Additionally, studies have examined the evolution of V2X communication and the rise of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Security threats targeting ICVs include attacks on traffic light infrastructure, communication channels, and sensor manipulation, alongside broader concerns related to DSRC and C-V2X communication security. Given the cyber-physical nature of ICVs, their vulnerabilities extend beyond communication networks, as adversaries can compromise power systems, manipulate vehicle controllers, and pose risks to pedestrian safety by injecting malware or executing unauthorized code.

"A load resource that can offer regulation service by adjusting consumption up or down under dispatch control (similar to AGC) and responds instantly to frequency changes (like generator governor action) is termed CLD in LaaR service. Under the current ERCOT market design, ERCOT sends generation control signals to Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) based on real-time system area control error to keep the target system frequency stable. Each QSE then manages its individual unit output to meet these control requirements. ERCOT does not directly control individual unit outputs. This control logic applies not only to generators but also to loads, provided the load can adjust consumption in response to the control signal. Fig. 2 illustrates a real-world example of CLD response to a QSE dispatch signal, demonstrating that the tested CLD can precisely adjust its load consumption in line with the control signal.

If there is a small mismatch causing perturbations, the signal passing through the amplifier will be significantly amplified. Since the parameter is a large number, the signal is magnified many times, indicating that even a minor parameter mismatch will result in a substantial decryption error. This leads to a decryption key sequence that differs from the encryption key signal, preventing the recovery of the plaintext signal.

"Furthermore, we investigate the security of the proposed scheme. Two SLs having identical parameters as those of the legitimate SLs are used as the hypothetical attackers who listen in the broadcast channel and mutual exchange channel, respec tively. The two attackers are, respectively, locked to Laser3 and Laser1 by amplifying the corresponding channel signals. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the-factor values of the eavesdropped messages degrade quickly as the bit rate increases. Therefore, high security can be maintained by increasing the bit rate moderately. Moreover, we propose to use the message coded by Laser3 as an encryption/decryption key (EDK), to reduce the risk that the messages exchanged between the MCSLs are intercepted. In such a scheme, the messages transmitted be tween Laser1 and Laser2 are not the plaintexts to be exchanged, but the ciphertexts encrypted with the EDK, then, even though these ciphertexts are intercepted, the attacker cannot get useful information without the simultaneous knowledge of the EDK and the specified encryption operation. For an instance, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the original messages are encrypted with the EDK by an AND operation before being uploaded to the public channel, and recovered by a corresponding AND opera tion after the ciphertexts being decrypted at the receiver end. The attackers can eavesdrop the correct messages if and only if they simultaneously know the AND operation and the EDK transmitted from another channel.",2010.0,Multiaccess Optical Chaos Communication Using Mutually Coupled Semiconductor Lasers Subjected to Identical External Injections,15-May-10,1

However, this measure only partially mitigates the attack, making it more challenging but not impossible for an attacker to forge an image.

"Generally, the CAS operates in a three-level hierarchy for 
key distribution as follows[2][5][6][7]. The server chooses a 
random variable Control Word (CW) as the seed of a pseudo 
random generator (PRG). A pseudo random sequence 
generated by PRG can be used to scramble the transported 
stream (TS). At the same time, CW will be encrypted by 
authorization key (AK) to form Entitlement Control Message 
(ECM). And AK and other entitlement information will be 
encrypted together by Master Private Key (MPK) to form 
Entitlement Management Message (EMM). ECM, EMM and 
the scrambled TS stream will be multiplexed into a new TS 
stream and transferred to subscribers in the broadcasting 
channel. Here, the ECM and EMM should be transferred with 
their digital signature respectively in order to prevent the

"The production cost of each power plant varies depending on factors such as its size, fuel type, location, and age. As energy demand rises throughout the day, the market clearing price increases until it aligns with the cost of the most expensive available supply. If a supply shortage occurs—whether genuine or artificially created—prices can skyrocket since consumers with inelastic demand must accept whatever price suppliers bid. During the 2000 California power crisis, the independent system operator (ISO) introduced price caps to curb market manipulation. However, energy prices quickly adjusted to these caps, creating a simple leader-follower dynamic without proper incentives. Additionally, the blackouts imposed by the California ISO unintentionally led to a form of retail price elasticity. Even under normal conditions, market manipulation can occur.

"In Conditional Access Systems (CAS), security primarily relies on the scrambling algorithm and the key distribution scheme. CAS typically employs symmetric encryption algorithms to scramble program streams due to their high information rates and real-time requirements in DTV broadcasting. The frequent changes in private encryption keys, such as Control Words (CW), make attackers more likely to target the key distribution rather than the scrambling algorithm itself. Therefore, securely distributing descrambling keys to authorized subscribers is crucial for the success of CAS. This paper proposes a key distribution scheme based on a four-level key architecture and grouping access control. The proposed scheme is designed to be secure, reduce encryption computation, and is scalable to handle subscriber additions and removals.

"An electronic dialing circuit connected to a home telephone can be triggered by an actuating signal from any type of detector circuit [9]. This actuating signal performs two functions: (i) it activates a relay circuit to close the cradle for a predetermined time to receive a dial tone and initiate dialing, and (ii) it sends an enable signal to a sequential logic circuit that injects a series of pulses corresponding to the chosen digits into the telephone lines. 
We utilize this capability to dial the resident's mobile number whenever a fire detector is activated. Upon detecting a fire, the circuit initiates a call to the resident's mobile, alerting them with a ring. The resident immediately recognizes the call is from home and understands there is a fire. They can then dial back to the home telephone with an additional digit, as described in Section II.B, where the telephone has a relay board extension to control selected appliances. Receiving the additional digit at the home telephone triggers a relay circuit to operate a solenoid valve, which activates a fire extinguisher electromechanically. The fire extinguisher is positioned at a chosen location inside the flat and can also be operated manually. If the resident is at home and receives the call on their mobile, they can choose to extinguish the fire manually or by making a return call.",2009.0,Analysis of Remote Control Techniques Employed in Home Automation and Security Systems,03-Aug-09,0
"The Delphi processes discussed are part of a broader initiative called educational Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS), aimed at creating a Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) and a Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA). The CCI is designed for students completing their initial cybersecurity course, focusing on foundational knowledge, while the CCA targets graduating college students entering the cybersecurity workforce, emphasizing advanced skills and competencies. To meet these distinct educational levels, the project concurrently conducted two separate Delphi processes: one for CCI and another for CCA. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory focuses on assessing the core concepts that students should understand after an introductory course, such as network security, cryptography, and risk management. The Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment, on the other hand, is geared towards evaluating the knowledge and skills acquired by graduating students preparing for careers in the field, covering topics like incident response, security architecture, and ethical hacking. Through this dual approach, the CATS project aims to establish a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity education and assessment, ensuring that students are well-prepared for both initial learning and professional practice.

However, significant variation of bias cur rent or feedback strength can dramatically affect the chaotic at tractor characteristics and may be detected by the eavesdropper as power or attractors change. On the contrary, the variation of  feedback phase is not evident by observing time series or RF spectra of the chaotic signal [8].

The feedback phase functions as a shared key required by both transmitter and receiver to achieve synchronization.

"In a chaotic communication system consisting of lasers subject to delayed optical feedback, the data protection is accomplished by the stringent requirement for almost identical transmitter and receiver devices. In this study, we assume that the above requirement no longer holds (i.e., the eavesdropper is equipped with an identical receiver). The proposed security scheme is based on a predetermined variation of the feedback phase and relies on the inherent limitation of the synchroniza tion temporal response. Hence, feedback phase plays the role of a key that both the transmitter and receiver should share in order to synchronize. One would argue that the application of an algorithmic encryption of the data before being encoded to the chaotic carrier would be a similar approach. This is not true, since the algorithmic encryption increases the required processing power and is vulnerable to possible algorithmic de cryption attacks. On the contrary, the proposed technique does not require any additional processing power, and its security relies on fundamental physical limitations.",2008.0,Feedback Phase in Optically Generated Chaos: A Secret Key for Cryptographic Applications,02-Feb-08,1

"In the described process, if the control word (CW) is not encrypted before being sent back to the STB, an attacker could intercept the transmission and redirect it to another descrambler of the same model, allowing unauthorized access to the content. This makes the system highly vulnerable. When the CW is encrypted, the session key (SK) plays a crucial role in maintaining secure communication. However, many existing systems use a fixed SK, which weakens security by enabling attackers to launch known plaintext attacks through intercepted communication. Additionally, the absence of mutual authentication allows hackers to clone smart cards or redirect authentication messages from a legitimate smart card-STB pair to other STBs, granting unauthorized access to subscription-based content.

"Cyber attacks targeting smart grid infrastructure can be classified into two primary categories: passive and active. Passive attacks focus on information gathering through techniques like spying, eavesdropping, and traffic analysis, without directly interfering with system resources or operations. In contrast, active attacks deliberately modify data and information using methods such as malware deployment and Denial of Service (DoS) campaigns, frequently resulting in substantial operational disruptions. The existing literature identifies various vulnerability points where these attacks commonly originate, including monitoring devices, substation infrastructure, and remote access pathways. Among these threats, False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) emerge as particularly prevalent and challenging to mitigate due to their extensive and varied impacts across smart grid ecosystems.

Research has demonstrated that if this functional form is known, DDF chaotic systems can be deciphered using curve-fitting algorithms [16].

"The relationship between vendor size, cybersecurity capabilities, and sourcing strategies reveals critical insights into organizational risk management. Larger vendors, often associated with single-sourcing strategies, possess greater resources and expertise to address vulnerabilities, supported by established cybersecurity frameworks and compliance protocols. These vendors dominate sectors like BFSI, where robust security solutions are prioritized, contributing to their market leadership (projected to reach $562.72 billion by 2032). Conversely, Best of Breed (BoB) strategies frequently involve smaller vendors specializing in niche markets, which face higher risks of business instability and limited investment in advanced threat detection. This gap is exacerbated by the 46% of cyber breaches impacting smaller businesses, reflecting vulnerabilities in resource-constrained environments. While single-sourcing reduces breach likelihood in organizations with narrow IT application spreads, its advantage diminishes as IT complexity grows, aligning with findings that no sourcing strategy shows significant differences in cybersecurity outcomes for organizations with broad IT ecosystems.

"Malware evasion techniques are increasingly sophisticated, with some malware applications employing over 50 parameters, thereby complicating detection processes [4]. Consequently, the development of methodologies capable of addressing the continuous proliferation of Android malware for efficient detection, deactivation, or removal is essential. These challenges have engaged researchers in the field, prompting continued investigation into effective malware detection and management strategies [5]. To this end, researchers have developed three primary mechanisms for Android malware detection: dynamic, static, and hybrid analysis methods. Static analysis involves the extraction of features that facilitate the identification of malicious app behavior without requiring actual application deployment [6]. However, this method is susceptible to code obfuscation techniques, which malware authors utilize to circumvent static analysis. Dynamic analysis, conversely, enables the detection of malware behavior during app runtime [7]. Typically, static analysis allows for the identification of malware components within source code, whereas dynamic analysis facilitates malware detection in a runtime environment. Android developers and users face significant risks and dangers due to malware [8]. This study encompasses malware detection methodologies, wherein Machine Learning (ML) models are employed to analyze Android Application Packages (APKs) for feature extraction. Both Deep Learning (DL) and ML approaches are applicable for the identification of malicious APKs [9]. Similar to malware detection, vulnerability detection in software code involves two stages: training ML models on derived attributes to identify vulnerable code segments, and feature generation through code analysis [10].",,,,0

"In the proposed protocol, a user must use a password to achieve mutual authentication with an authentication server. Without this legal authentication process, the system will not allow access to a USB port. Once authentication is successful, the user and server negotiate a key to encrypt/decrypt files transmitted via the USB port. This ensures that the data transmitted in communication channels and stored on USB devices is protected by the negotiated key.
For remote authentication, the protocol adopts the digital signature scheme proposed by Schnorr in 1989. The key feature of this scheme is that the parameters \( e \) and \( s \) are calculated and saved, requiring only one modular multiplication and one modular addition during signing. This method is cost-effective compared to other digital signature schemes. The signature length in Schnorr's scheme is \( |e| + |s| \). If the order of the cyclic group is approximately \( 2^{160} \) and the hash function output length is 160 bits, the signature length is 320 bits (160 bits + 160 bits).

"Malware invasive methods have evolved to evade detection, with many malware applications employing over 50 parameters, complicating the identification process. This necessitates the development of techniques capable of addressing the continuous growth of Android malware to effectively find, deactivate, or remove it. Consequently, researchers have established three primary mechanisms for detecting Android malware: dynamic, static, and hybrid analysis methods. Static analysis allows for feature extraction to identify harmful behaviors without deploying the application, but it is vulnerable to code obfuscation techniques that aid malware authors in avoiding detection. In contrast, dynamic analysis assesses malware during runtime, providing insights into its behavior in a live environment. Both approaches expose Android developers and users to unnecessary risks from malware. To enhance detection capabilities, machine learning (ML) models are employed to analyze Android Application Packages (APKs) and derive relevant features for recognizing malicious applications.

"The single-sourcing approach centralizes all IT system integration, maintenance, and troubleshooting responsibilities with a single vendor, significantly reducing the need for extensive in-house IT expertise within client organizations [4]. This model simplifies contract management by consolidating agreements into a single, high-stakes vendor relationship, as opposed to managing multiple vendor contracts [20][21]. However, this convenience comes at the cost of heightened operational dependency, as the organization? IT functionality, system effectiveness, and overall performance become critically tied to the vendor? capabilities and reliability [16]. While this reduces internal staffing burdens, it also introduces systemic risk, as any vendor shortcomings or failures could disproportionately disrupt the client? operations due to the lack of alternative support structures.

"Each power plant has a different production cost that de pends on the unit’s size, its fuel type, location, and age. As energy demand increases during daily operation, the clearing price goes up until it matches the production cost of the most expensive supply. If there is a supply shortage (true or contrived), this process could raise the price enormously, as inelastic demand will have to settle for any price bid by suppliers. During the 2000 power crisis in California, price caps were implemented by the independent system operator (ISO) to mitigate market power concerns. Predictably, energy prices immediately followed the price caps, creating a form of simple leader-follower phenomenon without proper incentive functions. The imposition of blackouts by the California ISO indirectly created a form of retail price elasticity.

"An inertial seismometer converts ground motion into an electrical signal, but its properties cannot be described by a single-scale factor, such as output volts per millimeter of ground motion, as is the case with position sensors. Its response to ground motion depends not only on the amplitude (how large it is) but also on the time scale (how sudden it is). Therefore, the suspended seismic mass must be held in place by a restoring force (electromagnetic, mechanical, or otherwise). When ground motion is slow, the mass moves with the rest of the seismometer, resulting in a negligibly small output signal even for large motions. This system acts as a high-pass filter for ground shifts, which must be considered when reconstructing ground motion from the recorded signal. Developing seismic detectors that can provide large output signals for both fast and slow ground motions, regardless of the rate of motion (similar to position sensors), remains a significant challenge in seismology and beyond.",2007.0,NEW PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION SEISMIC DETECTOR OF NANO-SCALE VIBRATIONS,02-Jun-07,0

"Many researchers mistakenly believe that security in chaotic communication systems is solely determined by the receiver's design. However, security actually depends on the difficulty of extracting the hidden message from the chaotic carrier without an authorized receiver. There are two main attack types: software and hardware. A software attack involves analyzing the transmitted signal. If the signal is captured with extremely high precision (picosecond sampling, which is very difficult to achieve experimentally), time-series analysis might reveal parts of the message. A hardware attack involves building a receiver that mimics the authorized one, but without knowing its precise specifications. This is challenging because the laser parameters and operating conditions of the transmitter, which are crucial for system design, are kept confidential. For this type of attack, an open-loop receiver is the simplest option.

"Each neuron in a neural network operates based on an activation function that determines the relationship between its input and output. These activation functions play a crucial role in introducing non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. The most commonly used activation functions, such as sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh, are detailed in Table 1. The connections between neurons, known as weights, are adjusted according to the learning algorithm implemented, which is discussed in Section II-B. This adjustment process aims to minimize the error between the desired output and the actual output produced by the network. By effectively updating these weights through techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent, the model enhances its ability to accurately predict outcomes based on the input data, thereby improving overall performance in tasks such as classification and regression.

"Cybersecurity breaches in power grids can have devastating consequences, ranging from unauthorized control over transformer switching operations to the transmission of false instrument readings. In extreme cases, attackers could manipulate transformer operations, leading to catastrophic local impacts, prolonged outages, and long-term supply disruptions. Even less severe incidents, such as false data injection or inaccurate instrument readings, can result in unnecessary shutdowns of functioning equipment, causing supply constraints or blackouts due to incorrect operational decisions. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing reliance on interconnected digital technologies in transformer protection systems, which expose them to threats like malware infiltration, Denial-of-Service attacks, and remote access exploitation. Addressing these risks requires a robust defense-in-depth strategy that includes securing hardware, network protocols, and operational processes to safeguard critical infrastructure against evolving cyber threats.

"In a Conditional Access System (CAS), certain program data is encrypted using control words to prevent unauthorized access [1][2][3]. Authorized users can decrypt the content using a smart card in conjunction with a set-top box (STB). Service providers manage subscriptions by issuing smart cards to paying users. Since most digital TV (DTV) broadcasts are one-way, there is no direct online authentication between the broadcaster and the subscriber. Instead, authentication occurs between the STB and the smart card to protect the service provider’s interests. Secure communication between these components is crucial, as it directly impacts the provider’s revenue. A fundamental aspect of this security is the key exchange process. Without mutual authentication between the STB and the smart card, a single card could be used across multiple STBs of the same model, leading to security vulnerabilities such as the McCormac Hack and smart card cloning [4]. The McCormac Hack exploits the data transfer from the smart card to an STB by redirecting it to another STB, tricking it into thinking it contains the same smart card. Smart card cloning involves copying a legitimate smart card to create multiple unauthorized cards, enabling illicit access to scrambled broadcasts. If hackers compromise the key exchange process, they can extract encryption keys to replicate smart cards or redirect authentication data to unauthorized STBs, resulting in significant financial losses for providers.

"In the CAS, security relies primarily on the scrambling algorithm and key distribution scheme. Given the high information rate and real-time requirements in DTV broadcasting, CAS typically uses symmetric encryption to scramble the program stream.

Therefore, securely distributing the descrambling key to authorized subscribers is crucial for the success of the CAS.

"In this proposed protocol, a user needs a password to 
achieve mutual authentication with an authentication server. 
Without this legal authentication procedure, the system will 
not permit access to a USB port. After the authentication 
succeeds, the user and the server negotiate a key, which is 
used to encrypt/decrypt a file transmitted via the USB port. 
Thus the bits transmitted in the communication channels and 
the files stored in the USB devices are all protected by the 
negotiated key. For remote authentication, we adopt the digital 
signature scheme proposed by Schnorr in 1989 [1]. The most 
important feature of this scheme is that the parameters e and s
are calculated and then saved, and when signifying, only one 
modular multiplication and one modular addition are required. 
This method can reduce costs, compared to other digital 
signature schemes. For the signature length, Schnorr’s length 
is |e| + |s|; thus, if the order of the cyclic group is about 2160

"A distinctive characteristic of reinforcement learning (RL) that sets it apart from other learning algorithms is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In essence, the agent's objective is to maximize rewards while interacting with its environment, which requires leveraging the knowledge gained from past interactions and associated rewards to exploit known actions. However, to enhance future decision-making and discover potentially better actions, the agent must also engage in exploration of new actions. This balance between exploiting current knowledge and exploring new possibilities is referred to as the exploration-exploitation dilemma, a fundamental challenge in RL that influences the agent's learning efficiency and overall performance in dynamic environments. Addressing this dilemma effectively is crucial for developing robust RL strategies that can adapt and thrive in complex situations.

"Joe Weiss? recent report underscores the significant cybersecurity risks posed by foreign-made power transformers and other critical grid components, highlighting their vulnerability to cyberattacks from external threat actors. Power transformers, essential to the electric grid's operation, are increasingly equipped with smart technologies that enhance efficiency but also introduce hardware backdoors. These backdoors could allow attackers to manipulate transformer operations, potentially leading to catastrophic failures. The interconnected nature of the grid amplifies these risks, as a compromised transformer can jeopardize the entire system. Despite these dangers, many utilities continue to rely on foreign-made equipment due to cost considerations, overlooking hardware vulnerabilities while focusing primarily on network security. This oversight leaves critical infrastructure exposed to hidden threats. The report calls for urgent action from utilities and governments to address these hardware-related risks and implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard the power grid.

Passive attacks, such as eavesdropping, spying, and traffic analysis, aim to gather system information without disrupting system resources. In contrast, active attacks, including malware deployment and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, actively alter or disrupt data and operations, often causing severe consequences. Among active threats, False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) are identified as the most prevalent and challenging due to their ability to manipulate data across multiple levels of the grid infrastructure.

"The goal of this problem is to maximize the expected social welfare, where ""expected"" is understood in the usual probabilistic sense, accounting for all possible contingencies and the pre-contingency state. In this model, load is considered as price-sensitive demand, and social welfare is defined as the difference between consumer benefit and producer costs. The OPF (Optimal Power Flow) objective function includes both the pre-contingency social welfare and the social welfare of each post-contingency state, as well as costs related to generator ramping and load interruptions (a market example for interruptible load is provided in [7]). The social welfare for each post-contingency state is weighted according to the probability of that contingency occurring.

"The study introduces a blockchain-enabled Cyber-Physical System (CPS) Aware IIoHT framework for medical applications, aimed at enhancing cybersecurity by integrating blockchain technology with machine learning to effectively detect both known and unknown malware threats while considering execution costs and security constraints. Blockchain ensures secure data transactions between hospitals, protecting patient records through decentralized, tamper-proof ledgers. Known malware threats are identified using supervised learning, which labels and predicts attacks prior to application deployment, while reinforcement learning addresses runtime attacks that may occur during operation, providing a dynamic defense against evolving threats. This dual approach enhances adaptability in the face of sophisticated cyber threats targeting IIoHT devices. Additionally, the framework employs cost-efficient blockchain task scheduling and lightweight cryptographic protocols to optimize execution costs and reduce energy consumption in resource-constrained devices. By uniting blockchain's immutability with adaptive AI techniques, this study presents a scalable solution for securing healthcare systems against multi-layered cyber-physical attacks.

"We have demonstrated that the SARI image authentication scheme lacks security when the same key is used to authenticate even a relatively small number of images. To address this issue, we propose a simple ""salting"" mechanism similar to that used in UNIX password authentication. Adding a salt alongside the image digest would require an attacker to have an impractically large number of images authenticated with the same key to produce counterfeit images. Depending on the application, the number of bits in the salt can be adjusted to make our described attack unfeasible.

A method for determining spinning reserve requirements, based on the system's 1-minute recovery frequency after the loss of its largest generator, was proposed in [4] and [5].

This time frame, known as the margin of time, represents the duration needed to adjust generator output. Different utilities set varying requirements for FRR levels and response times.

The ITDA space provides a straightforward way to condense detailed data into distinct categories, while a fuzzy clustering technique helps define the effective boundaries of the ITDA space for both single and multiple constraints. These methods can aid in determining optimal locations and operational strategies for DRs. However, for large-scale systems, the computational cost of CF calculations must be considered due to variations in system configuration, generation scheduling, and load levels. Future numerical analyses will explore these challenges to enhance the practicality of these methods.",,Identify the Impact of Distributed Resources on Congestion Management,,0

"We have developed a new class of super broad-band, nano-scale shift, and cost-effective position sensors. These sensors can extend the frequency range and enhance the resolution of existing vibrometers and seismographs by 10 to 100 times, depending on the base model.

The test model of our sensor can convert building and construction vibrations with amplitudes greater than 1 nm into detectable electrical signals, achieving high resolution due to its precision.

"Encryption and access control are similar in the sense that
they are both synonymous with privacy and prevention. A
notable difference however is that, encryption usually deals
with the confidentiality of data. Data can be available to
either a trusted or untrusted entity. Encryption ensures that
only authorized trusted entities can view the data. Access
control however tries to limit the access to data. The data
limitations usually happens amongst trusted parties. For
this reason, encryption techniques have to be stronger than
access control techniques. Encryption imposes very strong
limitations over data confidentiality. However, encryption
is not an easy task. It tends to be computationally expensive
and it has scalability issues (many users requiring access to
the same data). Access control tends to be more flexible, and
is easier to implement. When Big Data is transmitted to the
cloud, a security issue emerges. Most organizations would
not want their data in the hands of another organization,
thus the need for encryption. A common approach is the
use of data masking schemes. When the data is transmitted,
it is not encrypted because the approaches used to transmit
the data requires that the data be decrypted. This exposes
the data to attacks. Confidentiality breach is the biggest

"Many researchers often link security aspects directly to the receiver architecture, even though security is only indirectly related to the receiver's characteristics. Security primarily depends on the difficulty of extracting the message from the chaotic carrier without using the authorized receiver. Two types of attacks can be considered. The first is a software attack, which requires precise information from the transmitted signal. If the signal is sampled with sufficient precision (typically in picoseconds, which is experimentally challenging), time series analysis could be performed, potentially allowing partial extraction of the message [18]. The second type is a hardware attack, where an unauthorized receiver similar to the authorized one is used without knowing its exact specifications. This is highly difficult because laser parameters and operating conditions of the emitter are critical to the system design and must remain confidential.

"A recent online report [26] by Joe Weiss highlights the significant cybersecurity risks associated with foreign-made power transformers and other critical grid components. As essential elements of the electric grid, power transformers are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks from external threat actors, with grid interconnectivity amplifying the potential impact of a compromised transformer on the entire system. Concerns have been raised about hardware backdoors embedded in these transformers, which could enable attackers to manipulate operations and cause catastrophic failures. Despite these risks, many utilities continue to depend on foreign-made equipment due to cost considerations, overlooking the potential dangers. The predominant focus on network vulnerabilities, while neglecting hardware threats, further exacerbates risks to critical infrastructure, leaving power transformers exposed to hidden cyber threats. The report emphasizes the urgent need for both the utility sector and government to address hardware-related vulnerabilities to enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructure.

"A key responsibility of cybersecurity is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems [23].
This can be achieved, in part, by implementing a suitable
set of controls, policies, processes as well as organizational
structures that support a systematic mitigation of cyber risks.
Cybersecurity will continue to pose a significant challenge in
the years ahead. The implementation of best practices in organizations is greatly supported by the use of standards [24].
These documents serve as a set of regulations that specify
how organizations should carry out their operations and processes. Security standards are often embraced because they
are proved to be effective in providing well-structured security requirements and controls. They provide a multitude of
benefits that justify the time and financial resources required
to produce and apply them. A raising number of manufacturers and vendors are using these standards in order to
produce and sell standards-compliant products and services.
Governments and businesses increasingly mandate the implementation of security standards as well. According to a recent
survey conducted by Gartner, Inc. [25], 75% of organizations
are actively seeking security vendor consolidation in 2022,
which marks a significant increase from 29% in 2020. The
requirement for secure integration and compatibility of ICT
systems using technical standards is increasingly necessary.
This is especially relevant in open markets where individuals
have the ability to combine equipment and services from
various providers, resulting in cost-saving benefits for organizations. The rapid growth of IoT devices, cyber-physical
systems, and algorithm-controlled embedded systems like
autonomous vehicles and digital twins is also contributing to
this need [10]. Cloud computing relies heavily on standardization of hardware, software, and the services they run to
ensure interoperability [26]. However, as cloud computing
expands, connected systems will be exposed to new and
evolving cybersecurity threats. In response, a growing number of organizations are participating and contributing to the
development of cybersecurity standards. This has resulted in

"As substation automation systems transition to network-based communication, the risk of cyber threats to protection systems increases. A successful cyber intrusion could disrupt measurement transmission from an electronic instrument transformer and inject false data into the protection system, potentially causing misoperation. To complement existing security measures, this paper proposes a context information-based cyber security protection approach. When a fault is detected using measurements from one or more instrument transformers, data from the entire substation is gathered for pattern classification to validate the fault. A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is employed as a pattern classifier. Testing with real and simulated fault scenarios, generated using predefined rules, demonstrates that the proposed PNN effectively distinguishes fake faults from real ones using optimized smoothing parameters.",2007.0,Context Information-Based Cyber Security Defense of Protection System,03-Jul-07,0

"The lack of appropriate cyber security measures
deployed on Internet of Things (IoT) makes these devices prone
to security issues. Consequently, the timely identification and
detection of these compromised devices become crucial. Machine
learning (ML) models which are used to monitor devices in a
network have made tremendous strides. However, most of the
research in profiling and identification uses the same data for
training and testing. Hence, a slight change in the data renders
most learning algorithms to work poorly. In this article, we study
a transferability approach based on the concept of transductive transfer learning for IoT device profiling and identification.
Notably, this type of transfer learning works by explicitly assigning labels to the test data in the target domain by using the test
feature space in the target domain, with training data from the

comprising: 1) the device type identification; 2) the vulnerability assessment; and 3) the visualization module. The device type

"In Conditional Access Systems (CAS), program data is scrambled using control words to prevent unauthorized access. Authorized users can unscramble the programs with a smart card and a set-top box (STB). Service providers charge subscription fees by distributing smart cards to paying customers. Because most digital television (DTV) broadcasts are one-way, there's no direct online verification between the broadcaster and the subscriber. Therefore, providers rely on authentication between the STB and the smart card to protect their revenue. Secure communication between these devices is critical and directly impacts the provider's income. Without mutual authentication, a single smart card could be used in multiple STBs of the same type, leading to the ""McCormac Hack"" and smart card cloning. The McCormac Hack involves intercepting the data line between the smart card and STB and redirecting it to another STB, making it appear as if the card is present. Smart card cloning involves duplicating legitimate cards for unauthorized access. If the key exchange process is compromised, pirates can extract key information for duplicating cards or redirecting signals to other STBs.

"In a Conditional Access System (CAS), security primarily relies on the scrambling algorithm and the key distribution scheme. Since digital TV broadcasting involves high data rates and strict real-time processing requirements, CAS typically employs symmetric encryption algorithms to scramble the program stream. Due to the frequent changes in the private encryption key (Control Word, CW), attackers often target the key distribution process rather than the scrambling algorithm itself.Therefore, securely distributing the descrambling key to authorized subscribers is a crucial function that directly impacts the effectiveness of the CAS. In this paper, we propose a four-level key architecture for key distribution in CAS, based on a grouping access control mechanism. The proposed scheme enhances security while significantly reducing encryption computation. Additionally, it is highly scalable, efficiently handling subscriber additions and removals.The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on key distribution for CAS.

"Inertial seismometers translate ground motion into electrical signals, but unlike position sensors, their output isn't simply proportional to the motion's amplitude. Instead, their response is influenced by both the amplitude and the speed of the motion. This necessitates a restoring force to keep the seismic mass in place. However, during slow ground movements, the mass moves with the seismometer, resulting in a significantly reduced output signal, even for large displacements. This behavior effectively turns the inertial seismometer into a high-pass filter for ground shifts, which must be accounted for during signal reconstruction. Therefore, a key challenge in seismology is developing seismic detectors that provide strong output signals for both rapid and gradual ground motions, irrespective of the motion's speed, similar to how position sensors function.",2007.0,NEW PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION SEISMIC DETECTOR OF NANO-SCALE VIBRATIONS,02-Jun-07,0

"The foundation of our proposed attack is having access to multiple images with known digests and the use of the same secret mapping function for authenticating those images. The SARI system creators may have anticipated such an attack, as they suggested including the mean value of the DCT in each selected position for all blocks in the digest. However, this approach doesn't completely prevent the attack but only makes it somewhat more challenging. The attacker must now meet two requirements when altering the image: maintaining the DCT coefficient relationships as in the original and ensuring the mean of the DCT coefficients remains unchanged after tampering. Adding the mean value has minimal usefulness and only increases the size of an already excessively long digest.",,On the Security of the Digest Function in the SARI Image Authentication System,,0

"The absence of robust cybersecurity measures in IoT devices leaves them vulnerable to attacks, necessitating advanced detection methods, though traditional machine learning (ML) models often fail when test data deviates from training data due to their static nature. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a transductive transfer learning-based system for IoT device profiling, which leverages test data features from a target domain (e.g., a remote lab) alongside source domain training data to improve adaptability. The system integrates three modules: (1) device type identification using evaluated ML models (assessed via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), (2) vulnerability assessment drawing on Vulners, NVD, and IBM X-Force databases, and (3) a visualization dashboard for actionable insights. By combining dynamic transfer learning with multi-source vulnerability analysis, this approach enhances IoT security monitoring while addressing the limitations of conventional ML techniques in evolving threat landscapes.

An adversary can exploit this property to disrupt the system, especially if they have knowledge of specific ciphertext/plaintext pairs.

"Security aspects are often associated, by many researchers, directly to the receiver architecture although the security is re lated only indirectly with the receiver characteristics. Security is related to the difficulty of extracting the message from the chaotic carrier without using the authorized receiver. Two kinds of attacks can be considered. A software attack requires direct information from the signal that is transmitted. If the signal is extracted with enough sampling precision (usually picoseconds precision is required, hardly difficult to be obtained experimen tally), time series analysis could be performed and, in some cases, the message could be partially extracted [18]. The second attack is a hardware one. The idea in this case is to use a re ceiver similar to the authorized one without knowing the spec ifications of the latter. This is a very difficult task since laser parameters and operating conditions of the emitter are key pa rameters for the system design and should be kept private. For this second attack, an open-loop receiver would be the first and easiest choice.

"In CAS, some program information is scrambled with control words to prevent illegitimate user from receiving normally[1][2][3]. The authorized subscriber can descramble the program with cooperation of smart card and STB. The service providers charge subscribing fee by issuing smart card to the authorized paid subscribers. Since most DTV broadcasting is unidirectional, there is no authentication between the head-end and the subscriber on line, so the service providers utilize authentication between STB and smart card to protect their benefit. The secure communication between them is vital to the security of the system, which directly affects the revenue of the service provider. While key exchange is the essential part of the secure communication. Moreover, without mutual authentication in the communication between STB and smart card, one smart card can be used in different STB of the same type which will cause McCormac Hack and smart card cloning problems[4]. McCormac Hack occurs when the data line from smart card to STB is trapped and directed to another STB that acts as if it has the same smart card inside. Smart card cloning is that duplicating a legal card to make many illegal cards to allow unauthorized receiving the program. If key exchange process is cracked by the pirates, the pirates can extract the keys information of smart cards which can be used to duplicate many smart cards or redirect to other STB to entitle illegitimate subscribers to receive the scrambled program.

"Top security companies joined forces to share information
with each other in an attempt to gather intelligence from the
shared data (SecIntel Exchange). Their goal was to provide
reliable security tools for their clients, and to achieve that,
they had to learn as much as possible from evolving threats
that were developed each day. They understood the power
of collaboration for the greater good. This was needed
because with the rise of polymorphic malware and other
evolving threats, they needed a lot information on these
threats in order to fully understand what they were dealing
with and how to counteract against it. The traditional
approaches of classifying malware were proving to be futile.
SecIntel Exchange data provided them with the opportunity
to derive actionable insights from voluminous data. Human
analysis and traditional methods such as database storage
could however not keep up with the pace of the data that
was being generated [17]. There was the need to adopt modern approaches. As seen in a case study conducted by Zions

"The historical trajectory of generative models extends to the 1950s, a period marked by the development of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). A substantial enhancement in the performance of these generative models was realized subsequent to the emergence of deep learning methodologies [10]. An early method for sequence generation involved N-gram language modeling, wherein the optimal sequence is generated based on learned word distribution patterns [11]. The introduction of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [1] significantly augmented the generative capabilities of these models. The transformer architecture [12], a foundational technology for numerous generative applications, has been applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT. Generative AI (GenAI) has undergone significant evolution across diverse domains, including image, speech, and text. However, the scope of this discussion is limited to text-based AI chatbots, with a particular focus on ChatGPT, due to its relevance to this research.

"The Privacy Act of 1974 requires federal information systems to maintain the confidentiality of personally identifiable data [7]. However, these regulations offer minimal guidance on the specific structure and organization of technology-related functions needed to comply with such requirements. In most service industries, failing to implement security measures may not have severe consequences, but in healthcare, noncompliance results in increasingly strict penalties [8]–[10]. The stakes for security in the healthcare sector are particularly high. While information models are often used to analyze security concerns within individual organizations, there has been little research on broader industry-wide trends. The introduction of comprehensive industry regulations, along with penalties for failing to comply, may provide a more holistic perspective, especially when regulatory or market-wide influences challenge established practices within specific organizations.

"Practical experience highlights the significant role of pumped storage units in providing FRR for isolated power systems, especially during emergencies when reserves are critically low. Pumped storage units are highly effective in this role, as they can either generate power with AGC to provide frequency regulation reserves or operate in pumping mode to offer emergency reserves. Comparative energy benefit analyses indicate that mode C is ideal for light load conditions (such as in spring and winter) to minimize pumping energy costs while maintaining emergency reserves. In contrast, mode D is more suitable for heavy load conditions (such as in summer and autumn), as it provides frequency regulation reserves. The real-world operation of pumped storage units discussed in this paper can help assess their impact on system security and define their role in ancillary service markets.

As energy demand rises throughout the day, the market clearing price increases until it aligns with the cost of the most expensive available supply.

"While it is challenging to assess the periodicity and regularity of random numbers through statistical tests, the spectral test [8] provides a visual representation of how random numbers correlate with themselves. Two sequential 8-bit random numbers (ranging from 0 to 255) were plotted on a two-dimensional (2-D) graph, as shown in Fig. 3. If the autocorrelation of the 8-bit random numbers is low, the 2-D graph appears uniform and well-distributed. Fig. 3(a) displays the results for random numbers generated by our RNG, while Fig. 3(b) shows the results for random numbers generated by a pseudo-RNG (a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with 10 shift registers) [9]. The results clearly indicate that our RNG exhibits no periodicity or regularity, especially when compared to the LFSR. Although an LFSR with 10 shift registers is relatively simple, its circuit size is already larger than that of our RNG.

"Many researchers tend to associate security aspects directly with the receiver’s architecture, even though security is only indirectly linked to the receiver’s characteristics. The primary security concern is the challenge of extracting the transmitted message from the chaotic carrier without the authorized receiver. There are two types of potential attacks. The first is a software attack, which relies on extracting information directly from the transmitted signal. If the signal is sampled with extremely high precision—usually at the level of picoseconds, which is difficult to achieve experimentally—time series analysis could be performed, and in some cases, parts of the message might be retrieved [18]. The second type of attack is hardware-based, where an attacker attempts to construct a receiver similar to the authorized one without knowing its exact specifications. This is highly challenging since the system's design depends on critical factors such as laser parameters and the operating conditions of the emitter, which are meant to remain confidential. In this scenario, an open-loop receiver would be the simplest option for an attacker. However, as demonstrated later, retrieving the encrypted message is impossible if the encoded signal’s amplitude remains sufficiently low.",,Security Implications of Open- and Closed-Loop Receivers in All-Optical Chaos-Based Communications,,0

The findings indicate that when an organization has a limited range of IT applications, a best-of-breed (BoB) strategy poses a lower cybersecurity risk than a single-sourcing approach, though this difference diminishes as IT application diversity increases. Insourcing appears to reduce cybersecurity breaches more effectively than outsourcing strategies, including single-sourcing, best-of-suite (BoS), and BoB, but this advantage weakens as IT application diversity grows and is only significant when IT application spread is relatively low. Additionally, the BoS strategy shows no significant difference in cybersecurity risk compared to the BoB approach.

"Cybersecurity, fundamentally, is concerned with the assurance of data and system confidentiality, integrity, and availability [23]. This objective is pursued through the implementation of controls, policies, processes, and organizational structures designed to systematically mitigate cyber risks. The ongoing nature of cybersecurity challenges is recognized, with the application of best practices, facilitated by standards [24], being a critical component. These standards, functioning as regulatory documents, define operational and process guidelines for organizations. The adoption of security standards is predicated on their demonstrated efficacy in providing structured security requirements and controls, thereby yielding a multitude of benefits that justify resource allocation. The utilization of these standards by manufacturers and vendors for the production and sale of compliant products and services is observed. Furthermore, governmental and business entities increasingly mandate the implementation of security standards. According to data provided by Gartner, Inc. [25], organizational security vendor consolidation has seen a significant increase, with 75% of organizations actively pursuing this in 2022, up from 29% in 2020. The necessity for secure integration and compatibility of ICT systems, achieved through technical standards, is increasingly apparent, particularly in open market environments where interoperability of diverse equipment and services from multiple providers is required, resulting in organizational cost efficiencies. The proliferation of IoT devices, cyber-physical systems, and algorithm-controlled embedded systems, such as autonomous vehicles and digital twins [10], further necessitates standardization. Cloud computing, dependent on hardware, software, and service standardization for interoperability [26], faces evolving cybersecurity threats as its scope expands. Consequently, there is an increase in organizational participation in cybersecurity standard development, leading to a corresponding increase in the number of standards, with the expectation that this trend will continue, necessitating further standard development in the future.",,Gemini,,0

"Estimating the global state of a networked system is a critical problem in various domains, and traditional periodic observation methods are often inefficient due to high-frequency state monitoring. This has led to the development of event-based methods, which observe states only when predefined conditions are met. This paper explores the application of the event-based method to estimate cybersecurity equilibrium in preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics, an area where equilibrium is a key metric but lacks closed-form solutions. The study establishes that the proposed trigger rule ensures convergence to the true equilibrium and is Zeno-free, making it practical for real-world use. Numerical results indicate that this approach reduces observation costs by 98% compared to periodic methods. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenge of bridging continuous probability-state models, which estimate the likelihood of a node being secure or compromised, with discrete sample-state observations encountered in practice. This bridging mechanism is valuable as probability-state models are widely used to approximate complex discrete-state systems.",,,,0

"The primary objective of this research was identifying approaches to ""do better"" in cybersecurity education. Students demonstrating motivation and understanding of material relevance learn more effectively. The researchers propose enhancing traditional present-memorize-test educational models by incorporating incremental knowledge segments situated within realistic contexts through gamification, fostering emotional and cognitive investment from learners. For organizations across commercial, civil, and governmental sectors?egardless of size or complexity?rograms that effectively communicate and experientially simulate actual cybersecurity threats will enhance participant engagement while improving knowledge retention and practical implementation. Notably, this study advocates for a PTPA (Protect-Trace-Predict-Act) approach to develop responsive professionals who can apply their knowledge at critical moments. Current cybersecurity education often fails to help users, technologists, and managers connect specific behaviors with their negative consequences. Many users who experience system infections typically lack understanding of both the infection source and the decisions that led to compromise; they simply recognize something has malfunctioned. This inadequate feedback mechanism has created widespread cynicism, fostering casual or fatalistic attitudes toward cybersecurity. While users often possess theoretical knowledge, the abstract, distant, yet omnipresent nature of threats explains why people frequently fail to translate their knowledge into appropriate actions. This manuscript sought to articulate a pedagogical methodology utilizing mixed-modal approaches and conduct empirical testing to identify which modalities contribute most effectively to cybersecurity behavioral changes.

"The Conditional Access System (CAS) operates within a three-level hierarchy for key distribution. The process begins with the server generating a random Control Word (CW) as the seed for a pseudo-random generator (PRG). The PRG produces a sequence used to scramble the Transport Stream (TS).

"One of the primary challenges in contemporary cybersecurity is the overwhelming volume of data present in various datasets, which necessitates the use of intelligent algorithms, particularly machine learning, to extract meaningful insights. In the context of intrusion detection systems (IDS), the reliance on a high number of features is crucial for identifying the best approaches to detect potential attacks. However, this abundance of characteristics can lead to model overfitting, where a model performs exceptionally well on training data but fails to generalize effectively to validation datasets, resulting in poor performance. This issue underscores the importance of selecting the most relevant features from cybersecurity datasets to enhance the accuracy and reliability of intrusion detection models.

"The generalization power of AI has successfully transitioned traditional rule-based approaches to more sophisticated technologies, yet the evolving digital landscape has also escalated the sophistication of cyber threat actors. Historically, cyberspace experienced high volumes of relatively unsophisticated intrusion attempts; however, the emergence of AI-aided attacks has marked a new era, introducing both known and unknown transformations in cyberattack vectors. Cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging generative AI (GenAI) to enhance the effectiveness of their attacks, making them more potent than ever. Recent reports indicate that generative AI is being utilized to create self-evolving malware and craft convincing phishing emails, significantly increasing the volume and complexity of cyberattacks. This shift has garnered considerable attention from the cybersecurity community, as GenAI not only poses new challenges but also offers opportunities for improving defensive measures against these advanced threats. As organizations adapt to this changing landscape, the dual role of GenAI in both facilitating and combating cybercrime underscores the need for proactive strategies to mitigate its risks while harnessing its potential for enhancing cybersecurity efforts.

"The security of a Conditional Access System (CAS) relies heavily on the scrambling algorithm and, crucially, the scrambling key distribution scheme [10]. Due to the high data rates and real-time demands of Digital Television (DTV) broadcasting, CAS typically employs symmetric encryption for stream scrambling [5]. Given the rapidly changing Control Word (CW) encryption keys, attackers are more likely to target the key distribution process than the scrambling algorithm itself.

"When injection strength substantially exceeds feedback strength in the slave laser, the receiver reproduces the injected waveform through strong injection-locking-type synchronization. In this scenario, synchronization recovery time is significantly reduced compared to the previous case and remains constant regardless of complexity and external-cavity length. However, recovery times below 200 picoseconds have not yet been documented, indicating that phase variations of this magnitude would still protect messages from interception. Furthermore, in this operating regime, the receiver essentially functions as an open-loop system without phase sensitivity, resulting in very poor decoding performance for low-amplitude messages (as shown in Figure 2).",,Feedback Phase in Optically Generated Chaos: A Secret Key for Cryptographic Applications,,0

"The Conditional Access System (CAS) typically operates in a three-tiered hierarchy for key distribution. First, the server generates a random Control Word (CW), which serves as the seed for a pseudo-random generator (PRG). The PRG then produces a pseudo-random sequence used to scramble the Transport Stream (TS). Simultaneously, the CW is encrypted with an Authorization Key (AK) to form an Entitlement Control Message (ECM). Additionally, the AK and other entitlement information are encrypted using the Master Private Key (MPK) to create an Entitlement Management Message (EMM).The ECM, EMM, and scrambled TS are then multiplexed into a new TS stream and transmitted to subscribers via the broadcasting channel. To prevent unauthorized modifications, both ECM and EMM must be transmitted with their respective digital signatures. The Subscriber Management System (SMS) oversees customer access rights to protected services, allowing for the addition or removal of access by generating or updating the MPK stored in the smartcard.To enhance system security, CAS frequently updates CWs or employs more advanced symmetric encryption algorithms. In a typical CAS, CWs are changed every 5 to 20 seconds, significantly reducing the risk of known-plaintext attacks.",2004.0,A Scalable Key Distribution Scheme for Conditional Access System in Digital Pay-TV System,02-May-04,0

"The security of Internet of Things (IoT) communications is critical due to the large volumes of data transmitted between devices, servers, and customers. If the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of this data is compromised, it can lead to severe consequences, including data theft and unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, implementing robust cybersecurity measures is essential. Best practices include employing strong encryption methods for data both in transit and at rest, using authentication protocols like multi-factor authentication to ensure only authorized access, and leveraging firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and protect networks. Additionally, regular vulnerability assessments and network segmentation can help identify potential threats and contain breaches.

"The Transmission Service Provider (TSP) requires a different objective function for networks with fewer constrained lines. An alternative function, which minimizes the absolute value of transmission service charges, has proven effective in practice. This function works well because, as the number of constrained lines decreases, optimal nodal prices become more uniform, reducing the need for significant locational price variations to achieve Optimal Power Flow (OPF). The two objective functions have distinct characteristics. Maximizing TSP revenue ensures an increase in total social welfare and guarantees positive TSP revenue. In contrast, minimizing the absolute value of transmission service charges does not always yield these outcomes; it may result in lower social welfare or even negative TSP revenue.

aspect of our daily lives. Since cybersecurity has only recently established itself as a critical element of the
military, the military community relies heavily on the private sector to ensure cyber mission assurance. Given
the military?s secrecy, such reliance may increase the danger of mission degradation or failure. To address
this issue, the military has attempted to build a dedicated cybersecurity training system for the purpose
of internalizing cybersecurity training. However, existing cybersecurity training systems frequently lack
comprehensive support for effective and efficient cybersecurity training. In this study, we propose ICSTASY,
a scenario-based, interactive, and immersive cybersecurity training platform that supports a variety of
training features holistically. The primary requirements and design principles required to overcome the
challenges inherent in developing a cyber training system were offered based on a review of prior work.
Through the demonstration of our prototype, we have proven the feasibility of efficient and truly realistic
cyber training, not only for the military environment but also for the private sector.

"Learning methodologies in machine learning are broadly categorized into supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the model is trained using a dataset that includes labeled examples, where each input is paired with the correct output or tag. This allows the network to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs by analyzing these pre-labeled instances. Conversely, unsupervised learning relies solely on the input data, without any pre-existing labels or tags. In this approach, the network learns to categorize the inputs based on their inherent statistical properties, identifying patterns, clusters, or anomalies within the data. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks such as classification and regression, where the goal is to predict a specific outcome, while unsupervised learning is often employed for exploratory data analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction to uncover hidden structures within the data.

"Comparing signal-to-noise ratios between our new sensor and the SM-3 sensor, both installed in the same seismograph, reveals that our sensor is two orders of magnitude more sensitive. Furthermore, its ability to detect position shifts, unlike EMF-based sensors, allows for the detection of oscillating processes at extremely low frequencies, including quasi-static shifts. This capability is crucial for observing low-order free oscillations of the Earth's crust, long-duration tidal motions, and tsunami formation. Notably, it opens the possibility of revealing and studying earthquake formation origins in advance, a feat practically unattainable with other methods. Therefore, our sensor offers significant potential for seismic services in seismically active regions worldwide.",2007.0,NEW PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION SEISMIC DETECTOR OF NANO-SCALE VIBRATIONS,02-Jun-07,0
"Historically, manufacturing plants have operated in isolated environments, naturally forming air gaps that provided inherent security [3]. While Digital Manufacturing (DM) leverages information from diverse sensors and devices to optimize process and material flow, its distributed and collaborative nature introduces connectivity-related risks. A representative DM process workflow is depicted in Fig. 1. A significant portion of the pre-manufacturing phase is fully digitized, relying on computational resources and computer networks for design, simulation, and programming of manufacturing machine controllers. The DM system may integrate additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing (HM) machines. This process flow necessitates continuous connectivity throughout the process chain. However, this connectivity introduces security vulnerabilities that require mitigation through both traditional and innovative cybersecurity solutions applicable to various stages of the process flow. This article utilizes the hybrid machine (HM) tool as a representative model for DM, analyzing associated cybersecurity risks, developing an attack taxonomy, and proposing novel solutions for the DM cyber-physical system.

This transformation amplifies even minor parameter mismatches. Specifically, a small perturbation results in a significantly larger amplified signal. Since the amplification factor is substantial, any slight variation in parameters is greatly magnified. Consequently, even a minimal mismatch leads to a large decryption error, producing a decryption key sequence that deviates significantly from the encryption key.

In the first scenario, when the utility has excess power capacity, it offers customers interruptible tariffs to reduce some of the power demand and lower operational costs during peak periods.

In the second scenario, the primary objectives are to maintain system reliability and minimize disruptions caused by load interruptions when the system or a substation faces a capacity shortage. Since load management is highly effective in such cases, load interruptions become a suitable solution.

"Cyberwarfare has emerged as a pervasive threat, occurring globally and impacting various aspects of civilian and military operations. This new form of warfare not only disrupts military functions but also significantly affects daily life, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures. As the military increasingly relies on the private sector for cyber mission assurance, this dependence raises concerns about potential mission degradation due to the inherent secrecy of military operations. In response, efforts have been made to establish dedicated cybersecurity training systems aimed at internalizing essential skills; however, many existing programs lack the comprehensive support needed for effective training. To address these gaps, we propose ICSTASY, an interactive and immersive scenario-based cybersecurity training platform designed to provide holistic training features. Our study outlines the primary requirements and design principles necessary to overcome the challenges faced in developing such a system. Through the demonstration of our prototype, we illustrate the feasibility of delivering efficient and realistic cyber training applicable not only to military environments but also to the private sector, ultimately enhancing overall cybersecurity readiness against evolving threats.

"The decision-making processes in autonomous vehicles (AVs) heavily rely on machine learning (ML) models that analyze vast amounts of data from sensors and V2X communication systems to navigate safely, but this dependence introduces significant vulnerabilities that threaten passenger safety and system integrity. Adversarial attacks targeting perception systems can manipulate sensor inputs, such as altering road signs or obscuring LiDAR readings, leading to misclassification of objects or ignoring hazards, while communication channels can be exploited by attackers spoofing V2X signals to misdirect navigation or trigger collisions. Additionally, compromised electronic control units (ECUs) may allow hackers to inject malicious code, further jeopardizing critical functions like steering and acceleration. The integrity of ML models is also at risk, as adversaries can reverse-engineer algorithms or exploit hardware vulnerabilities to alter decision-making logic.

"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are pivotal in integrating physical and information worlds, particularly in critical infrastructure, yet their deployment raises significant cybersecurity concerns due to the potential impact of cyber attacks on human safety, infrastructure, and the environment. The process of transmitting information from sensors to actuators over wireless communication expands the attack surface, making CPS susceptible to various threats. Traditional security measures have focused on preventing unauthorized access through cryptography and access control, primarily emphasizing attack detection. However, as adversarial tactics evolve, it becomes increasingly challenging to completely prevent attacks, highlighting the need for resilience in CPS design. Resilient CPS are engineered to withstand disruptions and maintain functionality in the face of adversaries, with machine learning (ML) algorithms emerging as a key methodology for enhancing resilience. Recent research in adversarial ML suggests that these algorithms must also be resilient to ensure effective protection of CPS.

"In Conditional Access Systems (CAS), program information is scrambled using control words to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the content [1][2][3]. Authorized subscribers can descramble the program with the help of a smart card and a Set-Top Box (STB). Service providers charge a subscription fee by issuing smart cards to paid subscribers. Since most digital TV (DTV) broadcasting is unidirectional, there is no real-time authentication between the head-end and the subscriber. Therefore, service providers rely on authentication between the STB and the smart card to protect their interests. Secure communication between the STB and the smart card is crucial for system security, as it directly impacts the service provider's revenue. Key exchange is a fundamental part of this secure communication. Without mutual authentication, a single smart card can be used across multiple STBs of the same type, leading to issues like McCormac Hack and smart card cloning [4]. McCormac Hack occurs when the data line from the smart card to the STB is intercepted and redirected to another STB, mimicking the original smart card. Smart card cloning involves duplicating a legitimate card to create multiple illegal copies, allowing unauthorized access to programs. If pirates crack the key exchange process, they can extract key information from smart cards, enabling them to duplicate cards or redirect access to unauthorized STBs. It is estimated that media providers lose $100 million annually due to smart card breaches [5].

"As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the authentication performance of the proposed system is compared against protected approaches from [5], [7], and [8], as well as an unprotected system that employs Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a classifier [14]. The proposed scheme outperforms the cryptosystems in [5] and [7], which use a signature representation based on 100 parametric features from [15]. Additionally, it improves upon the transformation-based protection method in [8], which utilizes function-based signature representation. Notably, the proposed system offers greater renewability than the methods in [5] and [7] by enabling the encoding of longer messages. While there is a slight performance loss compared to an unprotected DTW-based system—currently considered the best approach for signature authentication—the method effectively safeguards signature templates. It is important to note that signature recognition systems, due to their behavioral nature, typically do not achieve error rates as low as those seen with fingerprint or iris recognition. However, the obtained recognition rates are comparable to those of unprotected signature-based systems when evaluated with E=5 and the same dataset [15].",,Fuzzy Commitment for Function Based Signature Template Protection,,0

"In a recent online publication [26], Joe Weiss draws attention to critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with foreign-manufactured power transformers and other essential grid components. These power transformers, vital to electric grid functionality, face increasing susceptibility to cyber attacks from external threat actors. The grid's interconnected nature means that a single compromised transformer potentially endangers the entire system's integrity. Serious concerns exist regarding potential hardware backdoors embedded within these transformers, which could enable malicious actors to manipulate operational parameters and potentially trigger catastrophic failures. Despite these considerable risks, numerous utilities continue deploying foreign-manufactured equipment due to cost advantages, despite the associated security concerns. The industry's disproportionate focus on network vulnerabilities while neglecting hardware vulnerabilities compounds these risks to critical infrastructure, leaving essential components like power transformers vulnerable to concealed threats capable of causing severe system disruptions.

"The imperative to address unpredictable real-world scenarios has necessitated the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into complex networks of interconnected entities, specifically Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) [36]. These Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) are endowed with the capacity to establish communication with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians through diverse communication modalities, encompassing V2X (inclusive of V2N, V2V, V2I, and V2P) and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). However, ICVs are subject to a multitude of complexity and security challenges [37]. For example, in scholarly work [38], a descriptive analysis of DSRC and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technologies and their respective architectures for V2X communication is presented. Concurrently, research [39] examines the evolutionary trajectory of communication technologies for V2X and ICVs, while elucidating the emergence of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology. Furthermore, threat vectors targeting ICVs include attacks directed at traffic light infrastructure [40], intrusions into communication channels and sensor tampering [41], and the security and privacy implications associated with C-V2X and DSRC communication technologies [42]. The security of V2X communication is of paramount importance, and numerous studies have investigated the inherent vulnerabilities within this transportation paradigm. Nevertheless, the cyber-physical nature of ICVs introduces augmented vulnerabilities to their communication frameworks [43]. Adversaries possess the potential to compromise vehicular power systems or controllers, thereby jeopardizing pedestrian safety through the injection of malicious code, malware, arbitrary code execution, and physical tampering with battery or controller components [44].

By doing so, it seeks to demonstrate how aligning similar requirements can enhance efficiency and effectiveness in cybersecurity practices.",,,,0
"The adoption of a single-sourcing strategy frequently compels organizations to implement systems that deviate from established business workflows, necessitating substantial re-engineering efforts encompassing procedural adjustments, policy modifications, and the enforcement of novel system utilization standards; conversely, a best-of-breed (BoB) approach facilitates the selection of vendors whose systems align more closely with existing organizational processes, thereby minimizing disruptive changes; the inherent process alterations associated with single-sourcing, however, introduce potential security vulnerabilities, as malicious actors may exploit weaknesses arising from procedural redesigns, while non-malicious employees, grappling with these transitions, may inadvertently commit security errors, thus exacerbating the risk landscape.",,,,0
"Wind-powered generators are primarily based on induction generator technology, which typically absorbs reactive power during normal operation. This absorption can lead to low-voltage problems within the power system. Furthermore, integrating large-scale wind generation into the utility grid alters both the power flow patterns and the dynamic characteristics of the system. As part of the system impact study, it is essential to analyze steady-state power flow under both normal and contingency conditions to identify any potential overloading of transmission lines. Additionally, calculations of short-circuit currents must be conducted both before and after the installation of new wind generation facilities to assess any increases in short-circuit current levels and determine if infrastructure upgrades, such as split-bus or breaker enhancements, are necessary. Dynamic simulations of the system must also be performed to verify the overall stability of the power system.",,System Impact Study for the Interconnection of Wind Generation and Utility System,,0
"An effective approach [1] integrated automated mapping with facilities management and a geographic information system to prevent distribution transformer damage caused by overloading. A pulse-width modulation-based control scheme [2] was introduced for the ILM to effectively reduce system peak load. However, utilities must establish agreements with customers by offering price discounts or incentive rates to form interruptible load groups (ILGs). The appropriate incentive rates for customers were explored in [3] and [4]. Additionally, a dynamic tariff [5] was proposed for demand-side management (DSM), presenting a real-time pricing strategy to help industrial end-users maximize their profits.",2004.0,A MODEL REFERENCE ADAPTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY FOR INTERRUPTIBLE LOAD MANAGEMENT,01-Feb-04,0
"Authenticators can be classified into three main types: secrets (what you know), tokens (what you have), and IDs (who you are). A password is an example of a secret, which can be a word, phrase, or personal identification number. Despite their widespread use, passwords have vulnerabilities. The primary issue is that short, mnemonic passwords can be easily guessed or cracked by determined attackers, while longer, random passwords are challenging for individuals to remember.",2003.0,"Comparing Passwords, Tokens, and Biometrics for User Authentication",12-Dec-03,0

"Cloud computing platforms can be highly attractive to conduct course assignments and empower students with valuable
and indispensable hands-on experience. In particular, the cloud can offer teaching staff and students (whether local or remote)
on-demand, elastic, dedicated, isolated, (virtually) unlimited, and easily configurable virtual machines. As such, employing cloud-based
laboratories can have clear advantages over using classical ones, which impose major hindrances against fulfilling pedagogical
objectives and do not scale well when the number of students and distant university campuses grows up. We show how the cloud
paradigm can be leveraged to teach a cybersecurity course. Specifically, we share our experience when using cloud computing to
teach a senior course on cybersecurity across two campuses via a virtual classroom equipped with live audio and video. Furthermore,
based on this teaching experience, we propose guidelines that can be applied to teach similar computer science and engineering
courses. We demonstrate how cloud-based laboratory exercises can greatly help students in acquiring crucial cybersecurity skills as
well as cloud computing ones, which are in high demand nowadays. The cloud we used for this course was the Amazon Web Services
(AWS) public cloud. However, our presented use cases and approaches are equally applicable to other available cloud platforms such
as Rackspace and Google Compute Engine, among others.

"Based on our current understanding of existing research, a cost-efficient blockchain technology, task scheduling, and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) scheme tailored for Industrial Internet of Healthcare Things (IIoHT) healthcare applications, that incorporates both execution and blockchain costs, has not yet been presented or proposed. Existing blockchain schemes, including Ethereum, Corda, and Fabric, primarily focus on security aspects, neglecting cost optimization for practical healthcare applications. Conversely, existing cost-efficient scheduling schemes aim to minimize execution costs and address malware attacks. However, the dynamic cybersecurity requirements of blockchain technology necessitate additional resources and time, resulting in processing costs for healthcare applications that are largely overlooked in the current literature.",,,,0
"A comparison of the signal-to-noise ratios for the new sensor and the SM-3 sensor, both installed in the same seismograph, reveals that the new sensor is more sensitive by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the new sensor's ability to detect position shifts allows it to identify the onset of oscillating processes at very low frequencies, starting from quasi-static shifts, which is not possible with EMF-based sensors. This capability is crucial for detecting low-order free oscillations of the Earth's crust and observing tidal motions and tsunami formation over several hours. Consequently, it may enable the early detection and study of earthquake formation origins, a feat that is practically impossible with other methods. Our solution holds significant potential for meeting the technical needs of seismic services supported by governments in the world's most seismically active regions.",2007.0,NEW PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION SEISMIC DETECTOR OF NANO-SCALE VIBRATIONS,02-Jun-07,0
"We have shown that the image authentication scheme SARI is not secure when the same key is used to authenticate even a relatively small number of images. In order to overcome this problem, we suggest a simple “salting” mechanism, much like the one used in UNIX password authentication. Appending a salt along with the image digest would require an attacker to possess an impractically large number of images authenticated with the same key in order to produce counterfeit images. De pending on the application, the number of bits in the salt can be controlled to make the attack we describe infeasible. The salt mechanism we propose is very simple and adds a relatively small number of fixed bits to the digest produced by SARI. Fur thermore, the mechanism we propose, in fact, is quite general and can be used in a variety of authentication techniques pro posed in the literature in order to circumvent attacks of the type proposed here and in [11]",2002.0,On the Security of the Digest Function in the SARI Image Authentication System,11-Nov-02,1

"At the receiver, a demultiplexer separates the Packetized Elementary Streams (PESs) within the scrambled Transport Stream (TS) and isolates the control data, namely the ECM and EMM. The EMM, verified by its digital signature, is decrypted using the Master Private Key (MPK) stored in the authorized smart card, yielding the Authorization Key (AK). Similarly, the ECM, also verified by its signature, is decrypted using the AK to retrieve the Control Words (CWs). These CWs are then fed into the same Pseudo-Random Generator (PRG) used by the server, synchronized via the server's synchronization signal, to generate the identical pseudo-random sequence needed to descramble the TS. The smart card, inserted into the receiver, securely stores the authorization data, including the MPK, necessary for control data decryption. The MPK is initially programmed onto the smart card by the service provider, who can subsequently update it remotely.",2004.0,A Scalable Key Distribution Scheme for Conditional Access System in Digital Pay-TV System,02-May-04,0
"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) bridge the physical and digital realms, offering transformative potential for critical infrastructure?et their vulnerability to cyberattacks poses severe risks to human safety, infrastructure integrity, and environmental stability. The wireless transmission of sensor-to-actuator data expands attack surfaces, challenging traditional security approaches focused solely on intrusion prevention via cryptography or access control. As adversaries grow more sophisticated, merely detecting attacks becomes insufficient; modern CPS must prioritize resilience?he ability to maintain functionality despite disruptions. While machine learning (ML) has emerged as a key tool for building resilient CPS, recent adversarial ML research reveals that these algorithms themselves must be hardened against exploitation. This article provides a comprehensive survey of two intertwined challenges: (1) leveraging ML to enhance CPS resilience, and (2) fortifying ML models against attacks when deployed in CPS. By synthesizing cutting-edge countermeasures and identifying unresolved gaps, we equip readers with a roadmap for advancing both resilient CPS design and trustworthy ML deployment in critical systems, concluding with actionable research directions to address evolving threats in this high-stakes domain.

"The proposed algorithm was practically tested on the LJ36 feeder of the Dar-Gun substation. The autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model was used to predict the feeder load. As shown in Table I, the forecasted load for the LJ36 feeder is based on the ARMA (2,1) model. The highest forecasting error is 6.22% at the 13th hour, while the lowest is 0.35% at the 9th hour, with an average forecasting error of 3.23%.
